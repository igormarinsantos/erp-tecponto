# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-02)

**Core value:** O balcão consegue rodar o dia a dia real — check-in até retirada, PDV, trocas/garantias, caixa — sem quebrar no meio e sem vazar dado sensível (custo/margem, senha do aparelho). Confiança operacional vem antes de polimento visual.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — OS.6 Closure (Warranty Verification & Deadline Wiring)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (OS.6 Closure — Warranty Verification & Deadline Wiring) — READY TO EXECUTE
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: `estimated_deadline` (existing OS-level field) is the field to wire — no second/competing deadline field, per direct grep evidence in research/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Roadmap: Design system is hard-gated as Phase 4, after all functional/audit phases (1-3), per `CLAUDE.md` §3 and explicit user constraint
- Roadmap: Audited field-edit (Phase 2) clones the proven `Tecponto Access Audit`/`user_access.py` pattern rather than inventing new audit infrastructure
- Roadmap: Systematic audit (Phase 3) is internally ordered PDV → Trade-in → Warranty → Caixa because Caixa aggregates cash movements from the other three — auditing it last isolates genuine caixa bugs from upstream ones

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 (Audited Field-Edit) has an open product question flagged by research: whether edits should be blocked once the OS reaches `Entregue`, or always allowed-but-audited — needs a decision during discuss-phase, not pre-decided here.
- Phase 3 (Systematic Audit) sub-question: the mixed-transaction-type caixa reconciliation test scenario needs to be designed against `cash.py`'s actual bucket-handling logic — worth a focused look before writing that test.
- Structural split of `App.tsx`/`api.py`/`test_frontend_api.py` (TECH-01/02/03) is v2-scoped, deferred out of this milestone's roadmap — new capabilities in Phases 1-2 should still land in small domain modules (per research) to avoid growing the existing large files further.
